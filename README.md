Program: myls
Description : myls is a program that runs similar to the linux -ls command. This program has
the functionality of the -h flag. To run said program type, "./myls" followed by a command. The flag
should be present after myls but before any other args. For example "./myls -h" should return
the current directory's file contents along with its hidden files. "./myls" on its
own will return the current directory without the hidden files. Try out "./myls -h dir1"
and "./myls -h dir1" to see the results of this program.

//TO READ THIS CODE CLEANLY, START WITH THE MAIN FUNCTION
//THEN COME BACK TO THE 'printDir' METHOD
